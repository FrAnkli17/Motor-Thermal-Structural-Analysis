# Motor-Thermal-Structural-Analysis
This project focuses on the thermal and structural performance analysis of a BLDC motor housing using ANSYS Workbench. The objective was to study the effect of heat generated during motor operation on the structural integrity of the housing and to evaluate thermal stresses and deformation under operating conditions.
